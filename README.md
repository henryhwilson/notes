I created this Notes app for my CS52 class.

I used several components (note, input bar, and app) to conform to React's standard component-based system.

I had difficulty grabbing the text reliable for awhile, but finally fixed it by creating a unique div ID for each textarea.

I also used an icon as a grabber to move the notes around the screen.
